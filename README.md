<h2 align="center">What Does the Tool Do?</h2>

<div align="justify">
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Data Collection:</strong> Gets historical data from the Kickbase API, including up to one year of 
      player market values and performance stats. The performance data covers matchdays, points scored, minutes played, 
      goals, winning team, and more.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Feature Engineering:</strong> Adds extra metrics that are not directly in the API. These are calculated 
      from the collected data and include things like market value trends, volatility, market divergence, and similar 
      stats to give more context.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Model Training:</strong> Uses a Random Forest Regressor to learn how these features relate to future 
      market value changes. The model is trained to spot patterns and make predictions about next-day market movements.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Daily Recommendations:</strong> Takes the model’s predictions and compares them with the players listed 
      on your league’s market and your own squad. The results are then sent to you by email every evening at around 
      22:30 after the market values update.

<h2 align="center">How Can You Use It?</h2>

<div align="justify">
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Fork the Repository:</strong> Click the "Fork" button to create a copy of this repository in your account.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Add Your Secrets:</strong> In your fork, add the following secrets.
      <ul>
        <li><code>KICK_USER</code>: Your Kickbase Username (usually your email)</li>
        <li><code>KICK_PASS</code>: Your Kickbase Password (handled securely)</li>
        <li><code>EMAIL_USER</code>: Your Email Address (for sending and receiving emails)</li>
        <li><code>EMAIL_PASS</code>: Password for Your Email Adress (potentially an app password)
          <ul>
            <li>
              An app password is a special password generated by your email provider for third-party apps. You usually 
              need it if your email uses two-factor authentication. Check your email account settings under "Security" 
              or "App Passwords" to see if you need one. 
              <a href="https://support.google.com/mail/answer/185833?hl=en" rel="noopener">Here</a> is an example on how Google handles this.

    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Test Your Setup:</strong> Go to the "Actions" tab in your fork. Click "Run Daily Predictions" and then 
      "Run Workflow". It should take at max about 2 minutes. If everything works, you will receive an email. If not, 
      check that all secrets were added correctly. After this, the tool will run automatically every day at around 
      22:30. Due to GitHub Actions limitations, the execution time may sometimes be slightly delayed.
