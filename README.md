<h2 align="center">Features</h2>
<div align="justify">
  <ol>
<li>
  <strong>Manager Budget Calculation:</strong> Based on the activity log in each Kickbase league and the points-to-money reward for each matchday, the tool estimates each manager's current budget. Since there is no access to other players' login bonuses or achievements, your own are used for the estimation. While not perfect, this approach still provides an accurate and practical estimate.
</li>
<li>
  <strong>Market Value Prediction:</strong> Using selected features such as points, minutes played, current market value, recent value changes, and more, a machine learning model predicts the market value change for the following day. This is done for all players currently on the market as well as those in your squad.
</li>
<li>
  <strong>Email Notifier:</strong> The results from the previous features are then sent to you via email each day around 23:00 (+-45 minutes), always after the market value updates around 22:00. As explained below, you can also run this manually at any time, without waiting for the scheduled execution.

<h2 align="center">How Can You Use It?</h2>

<div align="justify">
<strong>Note:</strong> The default competition of the tool is the first German Bundesliga. If you would like to change this, go into the main <code>daily_predictions.py</code> file and change the value of the variable <code>competition_ids</code> on line 49.

  <ol>
	    <li><strong>Fork the Repository:</strong> Click the "Fork" button to create a copy of this repository in your account.</li>
	<li><strong>Set League Name:</strong> In the file <code>daily_predictions.py</code> on line 48, change <code>league_name = "Your League Name"</code> to the name of your league. This must exactly match the name of your league, including spaces and uppercase/lowercase letters.</li>
    <li><strong>Add Your Secrets:</strong> In your fork, add the following secrets.<br>
      <ul>
        <li><code>KICK_USER</code>: Your Kickbase Username (usually your email)</li>
        <li><code>KICK_PASS</code>: Your Kickbase Password (handled securely)</li>
        <li><code>EMAIL_USER</code>: Your Email Address (for sending and receiving emails)</li>
        <li><code>EMAIL_PASS</code>: Password for Your Email Adress (potentially an app password)</li>
		    <ul>
		      <li>An app password is a special password generated by your email provider for third-party apps. You usually need it if your email uses two-factor authentication. Check your email account settings under "Security" or "App Passwords" to see if you need one. <a href="https://support.google.com/mail/answer/185833?hl=en" rel="noopener">Here</a> is an example on how Google handles this.</li>
	       </ul>
      </ul>
    </li>
   <li><strong>Test Your Setup:</strong> Go to the "Actions" tab in your fork. Click "Run Daily Predictions" and then "Run Workflow". It should take at max about 2 minutes. If everything works, you will receive an email. If not, check that all secrets and your league name have been added correctly. After this, the tool will run automatically every day between approximately 22:30 and 23:30. The scheduled time can also be changed in the <code>actions.yml</code> file. </li>
  </ol>
</div>

<div align="justify">
<strong>Other Use Case Options: </strong>The tool can be used without the email notifier. Just comment out the last line in <code>daily_predictions.py</code>, and the results will still be displayed in the GitHub Action execution log. As described in the third step "Test Your Setup", you can also always execute the workflow manually, and you are not bound to the scheduled time. The tool can also be used locally without GitHub Actions: for this, you need to have Python installed, and the packages needed, which are listed in requirements.txt. At last, create a <code>.env</code> file in the root folder with the same credentials you used in your secrets. You can then execute the main file <code>daily_predictions.py</code>. If you have any further questions or find any issues, please use the "Issues" tab at the top of the repository or contact me via the email listed on my GitHub profile.
